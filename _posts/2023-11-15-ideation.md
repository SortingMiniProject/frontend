# Ideation
## Project Overview:
## Objective:
- Utilize the iTunes API to retrieve music data.
- Implement sorting mechanisms using inheritance.
- Perform analysis on the sorted data.
## Technologies:
- iTunes API: Utilize the iTunes Search API for fetching music data.
## Project Structure:
## API Interaction:
- Implement a module to handle API requests and responses.
- Include functions to fetch music data from the iTunes API.
## Sorting Mechanism:
- Create a base class for sorting with common sorting functionalities.
- Inherit subclasses for specific sorting criteria (e.g., by artist, by genre, by release date).
- Implement sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, quicksort) within each subclass.
## Data Analysis:
- Develop functions to analyze the sorted data.
- Examples of analysis could include:
- Statistics on artists or genres.
- Trends over time based on release dates.
## User Interface (Optional):
- If you want a user-friendly interface, consider integrating a simple UI.
- Allow users to choose sorting criteria and view analysis results.
